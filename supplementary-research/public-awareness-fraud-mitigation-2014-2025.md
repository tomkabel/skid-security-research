# **Report: Effectiveness of Public Awareness & Education in Fraud Mitigation**

**To:** Cybersecurity Policymakers & Strategy Units
**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Subject:** Strategic Evaluation of Anti-Fraud Awareness Campaigns (2014–2025)

## **1. Executive Summary**

The effectiveness of cybersecurity awareness campaigns has shifted from a "nice-to-have" compliance metric to a critical layer of national defense. Research from the last decade indicates that while **passive mass-market awareness** (e.g., billboards, generic TV spots) has limited impact on fraud reduction, **targeted, interactive, and "just-in-time" interventions** yield measurable results.

Key findings include:

* **Targeted training works:** Organizations using sustained, interactive phishing simulations see susceptibility rates drop from **~34% to ~5%** over 12 months.
* **Tech-enabled friction is superior:** "Active" browser and banking warnings achieve **79% adherence**, compared to just **13%** for passive alerts.
* **Holistic ecosystems succeed:** Singapore’s integration of public education with technical blocking (ScamShield, SMS Registry) correlated with a **64% reduction** in SMS-based scam reports in 2022.
* **Revictimization can be curbed:** Targeted postal interventions for known older victims reduced repeat fraud rates by up to **22.4%**.

Policymakers are advised to shift focus from general "awareness" to **behavioral modification** frameworks (such as COM-B) and mandate technical "guardrails" that deliver education at the moment of risk.

## **2. Quantitative Impact**

Statistical evidence suggests that education is highly effective when it is continuous and measurable, but less effective when sporadic or generic.

* **Reduction in Phishing Susceptibility:**
    According to **KnowBe4’s 2024 Phishing by Industry Benchmarking Report**, the "Phish-prone Percentage" (PPP) across industries averages **34.3%** for untrained users. After 90 days of training, this drops to **18.9%**, and after 12 months of continuous reinforcement, it falls to **4.6%**. This data underscores that "one-off" training is ineffective; retention requires repetition.
* **National-Level Fraud Reduction:**
  * **Australia:** The **ACCC’s National Anti-Scam Centre** reported a **17.8% decrease** in scam reports and a **25.9% decrease** in financial losses (to $2.03 billion) in 2024. This success is attributed to a "fusion cell" model combining public awareness with rapid intelligence sharing between banks and telcos.
  * **Singapore:** Following the mandatory registration of alphanumeric SMS sender IDs (SSIR) and public education on the "ScamShield" app, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) reported a **64% reduction** in SMS scam cases between Q4 2021 and Q2 2022.
* **Prevented Losses:**
    **UK Finance** reported that in the first half of 2025, the banking finance industry prevented **£870 million** in unauthorized fraud, partly due to the "Take Five to Stop Fraud" campaign's emphasis on empowering customers to challenge suspicious requests.

## **3. Behavioral Change & Qualitative Evidence**

Education influences behavior most effectively when it moves beyond "knowledge transfer" to "habit formation."

* **The COM-B Model:**
    Leading behavioral science frameworks, such as **COM-B** (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation), highlight that knowledge (Capability) is insufficient without the Opportunity (e.g., easy reporting tools) and Motivation. Research indicates that successful campaigns must address the **"Optimism Bias"**, where individuals believe they are too smart to be scammed.
* **Reporting vs. Susceptibility:**
    A critical behavioral KPI is the **Reporting Rate**. Organizations with mature security cultures see a rise in users reporting suspicious emails even if they don't click them. High reporting rates are a leading indicator of resilience, turning users into "human sensors" for the security team.
* **Targeted Interventions for Vulnerable Groups:**
    A randomized control trial by the **US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS)** found that sending warning letters to older adults who had previously been scammed reduced revictimization rates by **8.6%** (single letter) to **22.4%** (multiple "Fraud Fighter" mailings). This proves that targeted, non-digital education can be highly effective for specific demographics.

## **4. Comparative Efficacy of Outreach Methods**

Not all educational interventions are created equal.

| Method | Efficacy | Key Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passive Mass Media** | **Low** | A 2024 study on a Danish bank's mass-messaging campaign found **no significant effect** on fraud reduction, suggesting that broad warnings ("Watch out for fraud") are often tuned out by consumers. |
| **Interactive / Gamification** | **High** | Academic research shows gamified training (e.g., "Cyber Shield Game") can improve knowledge retention by **~51%** compared to traditional slide-based lectures. |
| **"Just-in-Time" Alerts** | **Very High** | Research on browser security warnings shows that **"active" blocking warnings** (which require a user to click through a barrier) have a **79% adherence rate**, whereas **"passive" toolbar icons** are ignored by **87%** of users. |
| **Social Media Campaigns** | **Mixed** | While effective for reach (e.g., **Europol’s #ThinkB4UClick**), social media channels themselves suffer from high rates of impersonation, where fraudsters mimic the very agencies issuing the warnings. |

## **5. Limitations and Challenges**

Policymakers must account for structural and psychological barriers that limit campaign success.

* **Security Fatigue:**
    The **"Security Fatigue"** phenomenon occurs when users are bombarded with too many warnings, leading to cognitive exhaustion and resignation. Users may default to "clicking through" warnings to get their job done.
* **The "Forgetting Curve":**
    Without reinforcement, security knowledge decays rapidly. The industry standard suggests that training effects wear off significantly after **4–6 months**, necessitating continuous micro-learning rather than annual seminars.
* **Adaptive Adversaries:**
    As awareness of "typos and bad grammar" improves, criminals have shifted to **"Pig Butchering" (long-con investment fraud)** and **AI-driven social engineering** (e.g., deepfake voice clones), which bypass traditional "spot the red flag" education. ENISA warned in late 2025 that **80%** of social engineering attacks now involve AI elements.

## **6. Global Best Practices**

* **Singapore: The "Swiss Cheese" Defense**
    Singapore does not rely on education alone. Its strategy layers public education (ScamShield) with infrastructure changes (SMS Sender ID Registry, limiting banking transaction amounts for vulnerable users). The **"Add, Check, Tell"** campaign is reinforced by the tangible ability to "Check" using the official app.
* **UK: "Take Five to Stop Fraud"**
    This campaign successfully simplified the call to action: **"Stop, Challenge, Protect."** Its success lies in its unified messaging across all major banks, creating a consistent "brand" of security that reduces consumer confusion.
* **Australia: Fusion Cell Collaboration**
    The **National Anti-Scam Centre** prioritizes real-time data sharing. When a new scam narrative emerges, awareness messaging is adjusted rapidly, moving from general advice to specific warnings about current threats (e.g., "Hi Mum" family impersonation scams).

## **7. Strategic Recommendations for Policymakers**

1. **Mandate "Active" Interventions:** Move beyond passive advice. Mandate that financial institutions and telcos implement **"friction"** (e.g., cooling-off periods, active confirmation screens) for high-risk transactions. Education should happen *on* these screens (Just-in-Time).
2. **Standardize the "Verify" Step:** Create a verified, national channel (like Singapore's SMS Registry or a "111" government trust number) where citizens can instantly verify the authenticity of a communication. Education is useless if users have no reliable way to verify a claim.
3. **Target "Repeat Victims":** Allocate specific resources to identifying and supporting chronic victims (especially the elderly), as they are disproportionately targeted. Postal and community-based interventions work better here than digital ads.
4. **Measure Behavior, Not Clicks:** Shift KPIs from "number of people reached" to behavioral metrics: **Reporting Rates** (of suspicious texts/emails) and **Adherence Rates** (to security warnings).
5. **Regulate Social Media Advertising:** Given that social media is a primary vector for investment fraud, place the burden of "Know Your Business Customer" (KYBC) on platforms to prevent fraudsters from buying ads that mimic legitimate awareness campaigns.
