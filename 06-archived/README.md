# Archived Content

This directory contains the original files that have been merged and reorganized into the new structure. These files are kept for reference and historical purposes.

## Original Files

The following files were merged into the new organized structure:

## New Structure

The content has been reorganized into a logical structure:

- **01-core-analysis/** - Main security analysis and research
- **02-opinion-editorials/** - Opinion pieces and editorial content
- **03-technical-analysis/** - Detailed technical assessments
- **04-supplementary-research/** - Supporting research and alternatives
- **05-drafts/** - Work-in-progress content
- **06-archived/** - Deprecated/merged content (this directory)

## Rationale

The new structure improves organization by:

1. **Grouping by theme** rather than by author or file type
2. **Removing redundancy** - duplicate content has been merged
3. **Improving discoverability** - files are named consistently
4. **Creating logical flow** - from core analysis to supplementary research
5. **Preserving all content** - nothing was deleted, only reorganized

For questions about the reorganization, please refer to the main README.md in the root directory.
