# Comparative Analysis & Fact-Checking Review: Regulatory Intervention Against QTSPs

**To:** Legal & Compliance Strategy Unit
**From:** Senior Cybersecurity Policy Auditor
**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Subject:** Validity of Enforcement Mechanisms Against SK ID Solutions – Comparative Analysis with EU Precedents

## Executive Summary

The strategy leveraging RIA, TTJA, AKI for fixes is **valid**, supported by EU precedents. Regulators hesitate on revocation due to reliance, but Estonia's 2017 ID-card crisis (ROCA) shows RIA prioritizes trust over continuity for tangible risks.

## 1. RIA Powers (eIDAS & Vital Services)

**ROCA Precedent (Estonia, 2017):**
- Theoretical Infineon flaw in 750k ID cards.
- RIA suspended certificates despite no attacks, forcing updates.
- **Verdict:** Proactive on theoretical risks in ID systems; applies to Smart-ID QRLJacking.

**Camerfirma (Spain/Italy, 2021):**
- Repeated failures; Google/Mozilla removed from roots, prompting fines.
- Relevance: Market pressure if RIA slow.

## 2. TTJA Mandate (Consumer Protection)

**BankID (Norway/Sweden):**
- MitM fraud led to animated QR/App-to-App.
- Driven by FSA liability; EU Digital Content Directive strengthens "defective" argument.
- **Verdict:** Plausible; pressure via fraud liability.

## 3. AKI Powers (GDPR Art 32)

**Itsme (Belgium):**
- SIM-binding/proximity checks as state-of-art.
- **Verdict:** Valid; cite peers dismantling "risk acceptance."

**British Airways/Ticketmaster (ICO):**
- Magecart; failure to patch known vulns = Art 32 breach.
- Relevance: Negligence maximizes fines.

## 4. Risk Acceptance Defense Validity

Fails for QTSP:
1. Sole Control absolute.
2. Estonia precedent rejects user behavior irrelevance.
3. Market shift (BankID).

## Summary Table

| Mechanism | Validity | Precedent | Leverage |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **RIA** | Confirmed | Estonian ROCA (2017) | Critical (Nuclear) |
| **TTJA** | Plausible | BankID Nordics | Moderate |
| **AKI** | Confirmed | Itsme/BankID | High (Financial) |

## Conclusion
Analysis holds; ROCA dismantles defense. RIA rejects risk acceptance for digital ID. Precedents (ROCA, BankID evolution) support precept/GDPR sanctions.
